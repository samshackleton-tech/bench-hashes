# bench-hashes 0.21.0

**One copy of the timing code.** The code that reads every clock and load measurement is now part of bench-hashes itself, so a result's bench-hashes version names exactly what timed it. It measures as before: the code is the same.

**Fixes; it measures as 0.20.0 does**, so results from either read alike. The Python study tools read 0.20's results files again. The map's two-programs rows show their two-figures mark again. A `crowd` run's results say that its programs are the load, where they said the run was too short to judge. The help lists every subcommand.

**"Two programs at once" is measured for the multithreaded hashes alone.** Since September every nonstop cell was measured twice: alone, and as two copies of the program at once. For the single-threaded hashes the two always read the same, apart from where the operating system happened to put the two copies, so those 300 cells go. For the two multithreaded hashes the pair stays: it showed BLAKE3-Servil running faster beside a neighbour on a chip with several cache domains, which led to a fix, and two programs on one SME unit or one GPU are the same question. A full run on a one-cache computer is about a quarter shorter.

**The two copies are placed.** What two programs share decides what they cost each other, and until now the operating system chose it for every sample. Now the copies run on two cores under one cache, and, on computers with several caches, also under two, as a second row; on a two-socket computer each copy's input sits in its own socket's memory. Each sample records which CPU it ran on, and the copy that finishes first keeps working until the other has finished, so every sample is taken with its neighbour running.

**`bench-hashes crowd` is new:** many programs at once, one a CPU, each with its own thread pool, for the question whether a hash's pool degrades gracefully when twenty programs each start twenty threads. The samples files gain a `cpu` column (format v8); files from earlier versions are read with those versions.

**Every comparison names what it compares.** `bench-hashes compare` and `regress` print each side's builds: each one's bench-hashes and BLAKE3-Servil commits, and whether each tree was clean, a sigil standing for a changed tree. They say so when both sides are the same build. `build-against` puts each build in a folder named the same way, and `bench-hashes provenance` prints a build's name.

**Two fixes to the map.** Each column now stays in its place through both halves of a map, so a reader scanning down a column finds the same way of calling in it. A run whose BLAKE3-Servil checkout was cloned from a local folder now writes its report and map, where it stopped after measuring.

**Each result records the computer's idle states**: how deeply its cores can sleep, and how long each depth takes to wake from. On computers with deep sleep states, calls after a pause vary from run to run with the state the core slept in, so a reader can see why.

**Every result carries its whole record.** A map's "About this run" lists everything the run recorded: the exact commit of each program measured, each library's archive hash, the compiler, the CPU and its features, power and load. Each chart draws its record into the image, so a chart shared alone still says where it came from. On a phone, the overview keeps its row names in view as you scroll.

These are the changes since 0.18.3, which drew the published results for BLAKE3-Servil 0.8. The two versions measure "one input after another" differently, so compare results only with others from the same version.

**"One input after another" now means sustained hashing.** This covers streams, batches, Merkle trees and collections. 0.18 took each of these samples as 1 ms of hashing right after other functions' samples, so it caught the computer in whatever state they left it. 0.19 hashes for 100 ms first, then takes six samples back to back, which is what a program that keeps hashing gets.
- Most cells read within a few percent of 0.18.
- Some multithreaded and two-program cells read faster. On an Apple M4 Max, official BLAKE3's multithreaded streams read 21–27% faster.
- A few read slower. On the M4 Max, BLAKE3-Servil's multithreaded streams of 128 B to 64 KiB read up to 41% slower, because sustained load lowers its clock and slows its threads.
- The typical cell repeats more closely from run to run. On the M4 Max, the median spread fell from 1.5% to 1.1%.

**Calls after a pause or after other work are measured as before.** On the M4 Max they read about 1% slower (SHA-256 about 4%), because the longer sustained part of the run warms the chip first.

**"Buffers owned" and "buffers lent" are one measurement where the calls are the same.** That's every function except BLAKE3-Servil's multithreaded stream, for messages up to 64 KiB and for batches. Those two rows now read the same.

**The busy-computer warning sees more.** Programs that spend their time in the operating system, such as file copies, now count as well. The warning works on macOS again, and on Linux it names the busiest programs.

**A full run takes about 6 minutes on an M4 Max,** where it took 4. Your next run on the same computer, with the same options and power mode, starts measuring about a minute sooner. Before measuring, a run calibrates how much work each sample does, and 0.19 caches those settings. A later run reuses them only when nothing they depend on has changed, and calibrates afresh if its samples come out far from their intended length.

**The BLAKE3-Servil measured by default is 0.8.0 as released.** 0.18.3 measured a commit shortly before the release.

**The overview's bars:** in each cell, the fastest bar shown fills the cell, and its speed is the one written under the cell's end.
